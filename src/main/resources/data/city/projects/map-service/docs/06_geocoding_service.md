# Geocoding Service

## Overview

Reverse geocoding is the process of converting geographical coordinates into a human-readable address, which is crucial for various applications in the Woven City domain.

However, the existing reverse geocoding services using the existing web API can be slow and  limits the usefulness for real-time applications.

To address this issue, there is a need for a near real-time reverse geocoding service that can take advantage of streaming data. The service should be able to accept input from various sources, such as GPS trackers and IoT sensors, and provide up-to-date location information. The service should also be able to handle high volumes of data, process requests quickly, and provide an easy-to-use interface.

To develop a reverse geocoding service using streaming data that can meet the requirements of various applications and use cases.
