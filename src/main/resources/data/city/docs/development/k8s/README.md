# Developing in Kubernetes Kustomize

We are integrating Kustomize with Baze to provide basic validation to the kustomization resources. For more details, please read this [TN-0429](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13wuX_mBjuZ337uBNk_KoZQ5fsuwnwscqminQAzmKRd8/edit)

If your PR is failing the checks and you are adding/modifying a `kustomization.yaml` file:
1. (Optional) [Setup Bazel](https://developer.woven-city.toyota/docs/default/domain/agora-domain/agora_developers/development_environment/02_setting_up_agora_dev_env/#bazel)
1. Run `bazel run //:gazelle` so it can generate or update the `BUILD` file in the adjacent directory.
1. Don't forget to commit and push the autogenerated `BUILD` file
