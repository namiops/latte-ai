# Agora Infrastructure

## Welcome

This documentation is meant to help guide developers on Agora towards some of
the more common concepts, as well as provide some guidelines. This page is
meant to be a hub for reaching out to several parts of the Agora infrastructure
to explain it better to our developer teams.
