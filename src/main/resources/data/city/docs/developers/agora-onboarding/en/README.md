# Agora Onboarding

Welcome to Agora!

## What This Tutorial Covers

This tutorial explains how you get started with Agora, in terms of tenant creation and member registration in order to start interacting with Agora platform.

If your team is entirely new to Agora, please follow [Request Tenant Creation and Team Registration](#request-tenant-creation-and-team-registration).
If you are a new joiner of an existing team that's already using Agora, please follow [Request Member Registration](#request-member-registration).

## Request Tenant Creation and Team Registration

Welcome again! We assume your team is entirely new to Agora in this section. Instead if you are a new joiner of an existing team that's already using Agora, please follow [Request Member Registration](#request-member-registration).

We (i.e. Agora team) set up two kinds of things for you to get started:

* Tenant: This is the environment where you deploy your services. This is based on the Kubernetes namespace.
* Users: Each member of your team needs to be set up as a user of Agora platform. This is based on the Azure AD and the accounts are managed by Agora team.

Please take a look at the relevant tab depending on your situation.

!!! Tip "Tabbed Contents"
    === "If your code is in your own repo"

        Please reach out to us at [#wcm-org-agora-ama](https://woven-by-toyota.slack.com/archives/C02CVJLTMJ7) including the following information:

        * That you are requesting an entire team onboarding.
        * Your team name
        * Your preferred tenant name. It must conform to [RFC 1123 label names](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#dns-label-names)
        * List of your members' email addresses

    === "If your code is inside the Backend Team's repo"

        If our application code is inside the Backend Team's monorepo, the Backend
        team has its own procedures for how to use Flux in conjunction with
        Agora. For more details please refer to the
        [**Backend Team's documentation**](https://github.tri-ad.tech/R-D-WCM/wcm-backend-monorepo/tree/main/docs/setup)

We may set up your tenants and users straight away, OR we may talk to you directly to understand your needs and use case better.

We will be replying once we complete the setup.
