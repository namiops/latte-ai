Please click the `Authorize Slack Workspace` button. This will lead you to a
page to approve the Github App for your Slack Workspace. Please approve it for
the Woven By Toyota Slack Workspace.

Afterwards, if you return to the Configure Reminder page, you can now set your custom reminders.

## Reminder Options

By default, the reminder will be set to a schedule. However, most teams will want
immediate notifications. To do this, please select `Enable real-time alerts`.
You should see options like this:

Please select which options you wish to be notified immediately of. In addition, please also
set the scheduled reminder options. If you do not wish to be reminded on a schedule, you can
deselect all of the days to be reminded.

Afterwards, press `Create Reminder` to finalize your notifications. You are free to send yourself
test notifications by using the test notifications button as well.
