# Manifests for having an ad-hoc test with Agora Bucket with a developer sandbox AWS account

The intention of the manifests under this folder is basically the same as the ones under [the agora-bucket-test folder](../agora-bucket-test),
but the manifests here have slightly different configurations to use a developer sandbox AWS account instead of the Agora Bucket AWS account.

For more information, please see the README.md in [the agora-bucket-test folder](../agora-bucket-test).
