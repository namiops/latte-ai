## Manual changes

This release has manual changes.
When you want to re-generate it from Helm, make sure to re-apply the patches.

### Patch spec.loadBalancerClass
The Helm chart does not support setting this.
Patch the service as follows:
```yaml
spec:
  loadBalancerClass: LoadBalancer
```

### Patch envoyfilter-proxy-protocol.yaml
This `EnvoyFilter` is needed because we are using Proxy-Protocol to be able to
see inside Envoy logs the orginal IP address, as a part of Security Requirements
of Agora on Internet Epic
