# Keycloak

This folder represents the manifests used to build a keycloak installation based
on the Keycloak operator 18.0.0-legacy.

The keycloak version is set by the operator and this can accidentaly be used by
other versions as well - with unknown success levels at this stage



The folder `vault-example` contains example manifests that should be added
in an environment where you want to setup keycloak with vault.
