# msk-metrics-0.0.1

These resources are necessary [to view the MSK metrics on the Prometheus in `observability-dev` namespace](https://observability-dev.agora-lab.woven-planet.tech/prometheus/targets?search=).

Not necessary [to view them in `observability` namespace](https://observability.agora-lab.woven-planet.tech/prometheus/targets?search=) because the targets (`kafka-jmx`, `kafka-node`) have already exist.
