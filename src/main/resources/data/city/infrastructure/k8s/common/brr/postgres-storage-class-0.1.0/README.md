# Storage class for BURR PostgreSQL clusters

The folder includes a StorageClass manifest for PostgresCluster resources owned by the BURR team.

The manifests is generated by [the agora-postgres-storage-class Helm chart](/infrastructure/helm/agora-postgres-storage-class).

Here is the list of the files under this folder.

| File | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| [generate\_manifests.sh](./generate_manifests.sh) | A script to generate manifests |
| [storageclass-brr-postgresql.yaml](./storageclass-brr-postgresql.yaml) | `values.yaml` for the Helm chart |
| README.md | This file |
| Other files | Generated files by [generate\_manifests.sh](./generate_manifests.sh) |

You can re-generate the manifests by executing [generate\_manifests.sh](./generate_manifests.sh) from the repository root directory.
The script requires [helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/), [kubectl slice](https://github.com/patrickdappollonio/kubectl-slice), and [kustomize](https://kubectl.docs.kubernetes.io/installation/kustomize/).
