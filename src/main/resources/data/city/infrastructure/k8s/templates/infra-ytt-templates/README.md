# Infrastructure YTT

This directory is meant to be a place to store the following:

* YTT Template files for Infrastructure. This can include:
    * YTT Library files (`*.star`)
    * YTT Template files (`template-*.yaml`)

Files here are meant for **infrastructure only: the templates here use
Kustomize, Flux, and other infra files at the base for the templates**
Additional template files should be moved or placed in a more appropriate
location

**Please mark all files accordingly for better readability of the directory**

Additions can and likely will be made as the use of YTT and codegen expands in
Agora
