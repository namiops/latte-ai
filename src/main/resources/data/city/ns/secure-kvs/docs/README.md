# Secure KVS

Secure KVS is a KVS database solution with encryption-at-rest managed by the Agora platform.
Secure KVS is constructed with Steelcouch (an encryption proxy) and CouchDB,
and each user can get the encryption feature without any additional code 
because the encryption is transparently applied through Steelcouch.
