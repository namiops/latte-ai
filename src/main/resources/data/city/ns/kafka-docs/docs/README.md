# Kafka - introduction

## Role in Agora
As a developer, your application is part of the Woven City ecosystem. We have designed Woven Cityâ€™s digital architecture around microservices, organised around business capabilities. 

These services will frequently need to communicate with each other. Direct, synchronous connections are straightforward but as the ecosystem grows they become difficult to understand and troubleshoot.

In order to simplify service-to-service data transfer, Agora has provided a message bus based on Kafka for all developers to use.
