# What is Kafka?

Kafka is an extremely efficient, write-optimized, distributed data streaming system. 

Services can write and read arbitrary binary data separated into logical segments. Written data is automatically replicated, parallel reads are available by default, and the system as a whole is fault-tolerant. 

Throughput is very fast, with the ability to process thousands of messages per second. The system is also easy to scale, capable of handling large workloads with minimum latency.
