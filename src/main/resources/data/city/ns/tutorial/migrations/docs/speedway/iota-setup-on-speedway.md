# IoTA setup on Speedway

The Agora IoT platform, codenamed IoTA, will also be functional on Speedway. Users will have the ability to configure and utilize IoTA according to their needs.

!!! Note
    Please note that the process for setting up IoTA may change in future. We will constantly update this guide with the latest information. Currently, IoTA is in preparation on Speedway DEV and is only functional on Speedway Prod. Therefore, the following setup instructions apply only to Prod.
