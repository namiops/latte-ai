# Introduction

This section is about crunchy data's PostgreSQL operator and how we use it in Agora.

You can read the official documentation [here](https://access.crunchydata.com/documentation/postgres-operator/5.3.0/).

To get started, have a look at the section [New Postgres instance from a template](01_postgres-zebra.md).

Check out the [Troubleshooting and Useful Commands](02_useful-commands.md) section for some basic operations and commands to access, troubleshoot and debug your Postgres instance.

You can learn more about Postgres observability in the [PostgreSQL Observability Overview](03_observability-overview.md) section.
