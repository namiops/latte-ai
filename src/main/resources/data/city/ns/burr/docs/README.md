to offer stable functions and operations in preparation for the very first city
opening.

## Status

The features BURR v2 offers will cover major features of BURR v1 eventually.
Currently, some features are still under migration.

### Operation Status: Preview

The service is currently available on dev and pre-prod cluster as *a preview,
which is not supported officially.* There is no guarantee data in BURR persists

## BURR v2 Authoritative Info Service & BURR v2 User Managed Info Service

BURR v2 consists of two services, BURR v2 Authoritative Info Service and BURR v2 User Managed Info service.

Authoritative Info Service provides personal information collected and managed by TWC. Most of the traditional BURR functionalities are covered by this one.

User Managed Info Service provides personal information managed by users on their own, which is coupled with Woven ID more tightly.
