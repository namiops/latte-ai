# envsubst

`envsubst` is a Go package for expanding variables in a string using `${var}` syntax.
Includes support for bash string replacement functions.

*Note: This is a fork of [drone/envsubst](https://github.com/drone/envsubst/).*

## Strict mode

Use `--strict` if you want `envsubst` to fail, if an undefined variable gets accessed. By default, undefined variables
are substituted with an empty string, but when strict is enabled, an error is thrown when encountering an undefined
variable.

> [!IMPORTANT]   
> In CityCD we currently **always** enable strict mode for all applications. Please be aware of this.
> An example error would be: `âœ— variable not set (strict mode): "my_undefined_var"`

## Avoid Substitution

To avoid variable substitution you can use the following formats:

* $var
* $${var}

Variable substitution requires using curly brackets. It is recommended that if you do not want expansion and wish to
keep the literal string, then avoid using curly brackets entirely. The string `$var` will stay as `$var` after
substitution.

In the event you need to keep the curly brackets in the literal string, you can add another $ to escape the
substitution. In other words, `$${var}` will become `${var}` after substitution.

## Unsupported Functions

* `${var+default}`
* `${var:?default}`
* `${var:+default}`
