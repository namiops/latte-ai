# Propy

## About
Propy is named after Greek word [propylaea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propylaea) that served as the entrance to an ancient citadel.

In the Woven City network, devices not associated with individual usersâ€”such as shared terminals, robots, and IoT devicesâ€”require authentication. 

Propy(one of the core service in Agora), serves as an entrance to Agora network. It is a LDAP gateway between Woven City network and Agora network that help authenticating such devices.

For more detail on Propy background and design, please refer [go/tn-0479](go/tn-0479).

If you are interested learning about network authentication at Woven City network, the details are available [here](https://go/tn-0352).

## Development in local environment

### Setup environment
While developing you might want to run the code against a real environment. 

* The closest we have to it is the `local` cluster under minikube (gen1). Follow [this guide](../docs/int/onboarding/gen1/local_cluster_deployment.md) for setup.

* Another option is to use Speedway/local cluster currently developed and maintained by Identity team.

  * This is recommended, you will get argocd for deployments here which is what we will use in Speedway dev/prod environments.
  * Follow [this guide](../docs/int/onboarding/speedway/local_cluster_deployment.md) for cluster setup.
  * How to access argocd in local, refer [this guide](../docs/int/onboarding/speedway/local_cluster_access.md).

### Build image

> :note: If you make changes to the source code, you need to re-run these steps again.

#### Build the docker image

```shell
bazel run ns/id/propy:image.load
```

Check created image:

```shell
docker images | grep propy
```
    
### Deploy image

Update image:

In your branch, change the image specified in [infra/k8s/agora-id/speedway/local/3-propy/kustomization.yaml](/infra/k8s/agora-id/speedway/local/3-propy/kustomization.yaml) with the new name and new tag you obtained in step 2.

```yaml
- name: docker.artifactory-ha.tri-ad.tech/wcm-cityos/id/propy
  newName: <image-name> # e.g., ns/id/propy
  newTag: <image-tag> # e.g., image
```

Commit and push your changes to the remote branch.

> :note: It will take some time for [ArgoCD](https://argocd.woven-city.local/) to apply the latest hash commit in your remote branch to the current deployment configuration.
Wait for the synchronization to complete.
At this point, propy pod is expected to have `ErrImagePull` because the image is not yet loaded to kind.

Load your image to kind:

```shell
kind load docker-image <image-name>:<image-tag> --name agora-speedway-local
```

> Note:

If the propy's pod is not restarted after the image is loaded, restart the pod to run the recently-built image.

```shell
kubectl rollout restart deployment propy -n agora-id-local
```

Congratulations ðŸŽ‰ You have successfully deployed your recently-built image to the propy service.

If you want to push image to artifactory instead, the detailed documentation is available [here](https://github.com/wp-wcm/city/tree/main/tools/k8s-tools#how-to-build-and-push-to-artifactory).

## Usage
In your vm, you now are ready to use propy. This section includes sample requests.

#### Pre-requisite
1. Add propy hostname(` propy.woven-city.local`) to `/etc/hosts` file located in your EC2 instance.

```
<IP address> id.woven-city.local argocd.woven-city.local dev-echo-id-test.woven-city.local propy.woven-city.local
```

2. To test propy in local with servicenow dev, please use own credentials for now.
    > [!WARNING] Please do not commit secret or credentials to github.

    * Update `SERVICENOW_USERNAME` and `SERVICENOW_PASSWORD` in the secret `credential-snow`. 

    * Update `BIND_DN` and `BIND_DN_PASSWORD` in the secret `credential-bind-dn`. 

#### Request
Inside your vm, you can use below sample requests.

1. Search by MAC address

Replace bind dn `-D` and password `-w` values as per the secret stored in `credential-bind-dn`.

```shell
ldapsearch -h propy.woven-city.local -p 1636 \
  -x \
  -D 'placeholder' \
  -w 'placeholder' \
  -s one \
  -b 'ou=devices,dc=iot,dc=woven-city,dc=local' \
  '(&(objectClass=WovenDevice)(cn=f2:1e:8d:0c:3b:4a))'
```

2. Search by CN (Common Name)

```shell
ldapsearch -h propy.woven-city.local -p 1636 \
  -x \
  -D 'placeholder' \
  -w 'placeholder' \
  -s one \
  -b 'ou=devices,dc=iot,dc=woven-city,dc=local' \
  '(&(objectClass=WovenDevice)(cn=robot1.group-a.team-a.iot.woven-city.local))'
```

## Run Tests and Test coverage
#### Run tests:

```shell
bazel run :propy_test
```

while seeing their output and detailed report.

#### Test coverage:

Pre-requisite: You may need to install [lcov](https://github.com/linux-test-project/lcov) first. 

* Run [the coverage report script](./coverage_report.sh).

```shell
./coverage_report.sh
```

* Getting HTML output: Run below command from the root of `city` repository.

```shell
genhtml --output genhtml "$(bazel info output_path)/_coverage/_coverage_report.dat"
```

The auto-generated HTML file `genhtml/index.html` will be generated at the root of `city` repository.
