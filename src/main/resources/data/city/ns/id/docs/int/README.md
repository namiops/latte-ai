# Identity Team

Welcome to Identity Team! This is the Agora internal documentation for the Identity team. 
If you are a developer and onboarding to the team, we're excited to have you!

Please check the [external documentation](../ext#readme) if you are interested on usage of our tools.

## Who are we?

We are a group of engineers working on Authentication, Federation and Authorization leveraging
standard protocols and experimenting with new implementations.

We provide the foundation for user identification in the city, that can be further extended by
other teams. We also assist partnering teams with their design and implementations whenever
necessary.

## Services we offer
* [Keycloak](../../keycloak/docs/int#readme)
* [Drako](../../drako/docs)
* [Drakopolis](../../drako_polis/docs)
