# About Drakopolis

Drakopolis provides an API that allows you to manage groups and group membership. Such groups can then
be used by the drako authorization framework to protect your application.

## Access

The REST API provided by Drakopolis is protected by Drako itself. This means that
if you need to access specific groups and/or groups in a specific namespace, you need to edit
the policies (TBD)
