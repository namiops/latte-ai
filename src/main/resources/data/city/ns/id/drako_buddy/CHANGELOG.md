## [0.2.0] - 2024-09-26

### Added

- Support to auto-generate AuthorizationPolicies that allow connections to the workloads (pods) that are protected by Drako, i.e., pods whose services are labeled with `drako-buddy.woven-city.global/ignore: 'no'`. You no longer need to define the AuthorizationPolicy manually for each Drako-protected pod. Below is the example of the AuthorizationPolicy that is auto-generated by Drako Buddy:

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1
  kind: AuthorizationPolicy
  metadata:
    name: drako-buddy-<service-name>
  spec:
    selector:
      matchLabels:
        <label-key-1>: <label-value-1>
        <label-key-2>: <label-value-2>
        <label-key-n>: <label-value-n>
    action: ALLOW
    rules:
      - {}
  ```

### Changed

- This kubernetes operator name has been renamed from Drako Enforcer to Drako Buddy. The label that you need to declare in services of Drako-protected pods has also been renamed from `drako-enforcer.woven-city.global/ignore: 'no'` to `drako-buddy.woven-city.global/ignore: 'no'` ([more details](./README.md)).
