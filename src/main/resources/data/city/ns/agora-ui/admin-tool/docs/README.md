# About Agora UI

[Agora UI](https://agora-ui.agora-lab.woven-planet.tech/admin/) is Agora's admin interface. As the single entry point for interacting with the Agora platform, it is aimed at a wide userbase that includes engineers, product owners, admins, and other stakeholders. It offers the following benefits:

**Defined features and flows**

The UI displays all the component functionalities and features in one place, enabling users to get a quick overview of what is supported within the platform and to better understand the mechanics of the underlying services.

**Automated testing**

It also automates test calls to services and log checking, tasks that are prone to human error.

**Low-/no-code development**

It removes the need for traditional computer programming in a console, making it easier for users without advanced technical knowledge to configure the platform to suit their needs.
