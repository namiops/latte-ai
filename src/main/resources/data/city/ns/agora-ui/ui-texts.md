### Consent Management

As outlined in the Woven City Privacy Policy, Agora requests permission from users to access and collect their personal information (PII) on behalf of services like yours. Here, you can add and configure consent grants for your services.

### Consent Service Mapping

In Agora's consent mechanism, service identities are based on cluster and SPIFFE ID, which can be very long and/or obscure. Use the service mapping UI to assign simple names and configure your service identities.
