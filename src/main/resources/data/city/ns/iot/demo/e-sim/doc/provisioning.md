# IoTSAFE applet provisioning policy

* The requirements for provisioning (writing secret keys, etc.) and remote management for the IoTSAFE applet are specified in the GSMA specification (IoT.04 - Common Implementation Guide to Using the SIM as a ‘Root of Trust’ to Secure IoT Applications, Clause 3.2.3.1).

* Provisioning (writing secret keys, etc.) and remote management are carried out using the APDU command "STORE DATA".

* The implementation status for each function is as follows.
