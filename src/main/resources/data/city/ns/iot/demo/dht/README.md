# Python script to read DHT sensor

## What is it?
This is a simple sample script designed to read temperature and humidity values from DHT sensors and display the results in the terminal window.

## How to run it?
You have to run it inside the Raspi otherwise it will fail.

To run it:
```bash
python3 read.py
```

You may need to adjust your pin number `board.D4` to make it work properly.
