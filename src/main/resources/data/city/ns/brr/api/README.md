# BURR API specs

This directory contains the API specification files for BURR.

## Current API specs

Files directly in this directory reflect the **"current" state** of the APIs, i.e. 
what is currently implemented and what is detail-designed and will be implemented soon.

**Goal:** serve as development reference for service teams.

Endpoints that are not (or not completely) implemented are labeled as such in the
API spec file.

## Planned / future changes to APIs

Files in the `planned` directory reflect considerations and plans for the future. 
See [`planned/README.md`](planned/README.md) for more info.

**Goal:** serve as a discussion and feedback document for BURR team and service teams.
