# Build info library

This crate provides information about the build to Rust code, so that it may be
included in logs, etc.  
The code relies on _build time_ environment variables set in the BUILD file,
that are populated with stamped values generated by Bazel.

# How to use

Start by adding a dependency on the `build_info` crate/library in your BUILD file.
If you also need to maintain a Cargo build for your project (for local testing, etc.),
add the dependency (using `build-info = { path = "..."}`) in your Cargo.toml as well.
Note, however, that Cargo builds _will not_ contain build information, as this
information is obtained from Bazel.

Once that's done, in your code you should be able to instantiate a `BuildInfo` object:

```rust
let build_info = build_info::BuildInfo::default();
```

This implements `Debug` and `Display`, so you can include it in logs, etc.
