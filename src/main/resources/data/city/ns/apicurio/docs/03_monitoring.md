# Monitoring

You can check the metrics such as the number of API calls at [the Grafana dashboard](http://go/agora-apicurio-dashboard)

## (JFYI) Alerting

The agora orchestration team cares about the alerting, so you don't have to check that.

The alerting list is in http://go/agora-orchestration-alerts and the alerts will be notified
in [the slack channel for orchestration alerts](https://woven-by-toyota.slack.com/archives/C04RE5GP8JC).
