# Agora Privacy Services

## Overview
Privacy is a first class citizen in Woven City and in Agora; we are striving
to do our best to make services, and users secure and prevent as many possible
threats or attack surfaces as possible to ensure that Woven City is a safe
place for users to provide data, invent technologies, and enjoy their daily
lives. In our privacy domains, the Agora team provides the following guidelines
(so far!) to help with making the platform safe and also easy for development.
