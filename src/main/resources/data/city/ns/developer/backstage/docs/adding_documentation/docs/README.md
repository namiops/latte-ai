# Adding new documentation to the Developer Portal

This documentation describes the use of the developer portal and how users can register and upload their documents to it. The goal of the developer portal is to provide all members of Woven City Management a catalog of all available services and how to work with these systems.

## How to use this documentation

These documents describe Agora Team's guidelines and current best practices for organization of documents that live in the Developer Portal. By following the guidelines within, developers should be able to host their documentation in a manner that maximizes its visibility and its accessibility.

## How Documentation is hosted on the Developer Portal

The Developer Portal is powered by [Backstage](https://backstage.io/). Backstage is open-source tooling for a centralized software catalog. The main leverage points for using Backstage is being able to use Documentation as Code (DaC). This allows documentation to live with the code it's related to, and any changes made are immediately reflected in the developer portal. This aligns with Agora's GitOps designs.

### How we leverage Backstage

Documentation is hosted and arranged based on Backstage's [Entity Model](https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-catalog/system-model). This model allows for the Developer Portal to link related services, components, and resources together to help with navigation and to understand the scope of the project. Agora's guidelines are based on the system model, with some additional recommendations on top.
