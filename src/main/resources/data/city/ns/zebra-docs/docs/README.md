# Zebra

Code abstraction tooling provides a useful system to make onboarding easier for service developers. Zebra is primarily a philosophy and opinionated set of examples for providing this type of system, and is easily extensible to a variety of use cases.

## Who should read this

This documentation covers two main audiences: 
* *End users of Zebra components*: While the documentation for actual usage of an individual component, such as Kafka configuration, will reside with that component, this document provides  high-level background to understand how the system works.

* *Authors of Zebra components*: Understanding the core workings of Zebra will allow you to add abstraction for your own use cases, and provide a starting point beyond copying-and-pasting an existing one.
