# [Just for reference] kafka-connect-wikimedia

**NOTE** This directory can be deployed just for test. This should be removed after the test because:
- exposing the internet connection for https://stream.wikimedia.org
- introducing the jar created by outside of the company

This dir contains deployment files for https://github.com/conduktor/kafka-connect-wikimedia
(If this is deleted, see https://github.tri-ad.tech/kohei-watanabe/kafka-connect-wikimedia) 

About the usage of `KafkaConnect` and `KafkaConnector`, see https://developer.woven-city.toyota/docs/default/system/kafka/10_kafka_connect/#deploying-kafka-connect-in-agora
