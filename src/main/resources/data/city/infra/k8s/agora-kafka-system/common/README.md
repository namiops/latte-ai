## changes

### 0.4.1

- Set the default namespace from `kafka-operator-system` to `agora-kafka-system` for the Speedway environment
- Remove the `Namespace` resource because it is generated by [the CityCD pipeline](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WGbYMc5XMKCqXkXiel_5d-vskgdxqNdsXEvd4l1I28U/edit)
- Add extra `securityContext` in accordance with the content described here (https://security.woven-planet.tech/standards/cloud-and-kubernetes/k8s-configuration-standard/#pod-security) and ensured it passes the gatekeeper rules for the Speedway production environment
- Add `argocd.argoproj.io/sync-options: ServerSideApply=true` to the CRD to avoid the ArgoCD applying error "Failed sync attempt to <UUID>: one or more objects failed to apply, reason: CustomResourceDefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io <CRD> is invalid: metadata.annotations: Too long: must have at most 262144 bytes (retried 5 times)."
